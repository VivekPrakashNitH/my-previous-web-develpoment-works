    <!-- lec 75 pseudo class -->
    <!-- ! 
    ? In CSS, a pseudo-class is a keyword that is used to select and style elements based on their state or position in the document tree. Pseudo-classes allow you to target elements that cannot be selected using regular selectors alone.

?Pseudo-classes are added to selectors and preceded by a colon (":"). They provide information about the element's state or context, such as whether it is being hovered over, clicked, or the first child of its parent. Here are a few examples of commonly used pseudo-classes:

 ?   :hover: It selects an element when the user hovers over it with the cursor.
 ?   :active: It selects an element when it is being activated or clicked by the user.
?  :focus: It selects an element when it receives focus, typically when the user interacts with it using a keyboard or a pointing device.
   ? :first-child: It selects the first child element of its parent.
 ?   :last-child: It selects the last child element of its parent.
  ?  :nth-child(n): It selects the nth child element of its parent, where n can be a number, a keyword, or an expression.
? visited websites
? checked
Pseudo-classes can also be combined with other selectors to create more specific targeting. For example, you can use the :hover pseudo-class with a class or ID selector to style a specific element when it's being hovered over.

Pseudo-classes provide a powerful way to apply styles based on dynamic states or relationships between elements, allowing for more interactive and responsive web designs.
