    <h1>Pangolin</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from Ancient Greek φολῐ́ς,
        "horny
        scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises the
        four
        species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in Sub-Saharan Africa.
        These
        species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also known.
    </p>
    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with this
        feature. They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet
        consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary
        animals,
        meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two years.</p>

    <h2>Poaching</h2>

    <p>Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in Chinese traditional medicine)
        and
        heavy deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the world.As of January
        2020,
        of the eight species of pangolin, three (Manis culionensis, M. pentadactyla and M. javanica) are listed as
        critically endangered, three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) are listed as
        endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and Smutsia temminckii) are listed as vulnerable on the Red List of
        Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of </p>

    <!-- div elements -->


    <!-- there are two types of elements in html  
    
    1) block elements - take a whole block of itself amd separates them from other elements like <p>,<h1>,<h2>
    tag sepates itself from others by having a line of space at it's begginning and ending
     
    2) inline elements - fits in with other elements in line side by side 





    -->
    well that will show off the
    <div>
        anything i wrte shoukd be displayed and it just takes up tis own space
    </div>


    <!--


        div - the elemnts inside are treated as block elements
        
        div tag - it is just a generic container to hold things and group them together 
          
        why we need it -
         coz in css we need to group content together and apply css at once on them 



         how do we apply it?
         it hs concepts similar to oops
          
         
         we define using div class : and them write all the css we want to apply to it 


          now wrap the text in
          
          < div class : name of the class >
          .
          .
          .
            </div>
    
    
    -->








    <!--


        span tag - the elements inside are treated as inline elements

        span tag - same as div has class to distinguish them  but it doesn't cause them to form a line or create a block for themselves

        about tags :-
        
        Hr - just creates a horizontal line accross the web page . It is not  a container tag

        
        Br - breaks a line and starts from a brand new line. It is not  a container tag
  

              hjgjgkjb  <br> jkgjkhjlhjl   (creates a new line)

        Sup - used to write super scripts. It is a container tag

    <!-- LEC 35 -  ENTITY CODES  
    
    
    entity codes are used to print or show elements in the code itself 
    so for 
    < we use &lt;
    for 
    > we use &gt; 
     or for 
      & we use &amp;


       
    
    
    and many more emlements like this are written in this way coz < and > are used in the html language as a 
    opening and closing tags in the html and so not to confuse them with anything just serach the term in google 
    and find it 
    go to entitycode.com for finding more codes like this

    <!-- LEC 36 SEMANTIC MARKUPS
    
    
    
    // we can use shift+ end to select a line to the end from a particular instance or character

    
    and use alt + dwn key or up key to put a line above or bellow a code

    <!-- lec 37- playing with semantic elements   -->

    <!-- <main> - represents the dominant content of the page  -->

    <!-- now we havemany container tags sich as <nav> etc -->

    <!-- now we have the <section> tag which is just same as div just a generic container -->

    <!-- LEC 39--- EMMETS VERY IMPORTANT -->
    <!-- use main>section>h1 and then press tab -->
    <!-- nice to have shortcut for child elements -->
    <!-- for siblings that is on the same level use + and then tab -->
    <!-- multiplication like ul>li*5  sand see the magic-->
    <!-- best see the video agagin  -->
